# ti_praktikum_2016

This repository is meant to get users of the Fawkes Robotics software stack released by the Carologistics RoboCup Logistics League Team in 2015.
Instead of the CLIPS-Agent used by the Carologistics team this repository focuses on using YAGI (http://yagi.ist.tugraz.at/).

Please have a look at the tutorial.pdf in this repository for further instructions.
